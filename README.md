# Artwork

A repo for my public domain art and images.

## RawGit

It's difficult to get GitHub to serve image files with the correct headers directly from a repository.  GitHub always wants to serve text.  You can use [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/) to wrap the GitHub response and get the correct results, as I do in this README.

## Swift Package Manager

I could not find a GitHub Swift Package Manager compatability icon, so I created one.  I'm not sure whether people will start using the acronym `spm` as happened with Node.js, but I hope that this happens. It's less of a mouthful! I created two possible icons and we'll see which one sticks.
